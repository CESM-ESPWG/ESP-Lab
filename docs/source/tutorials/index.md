# Tutorial

Notebooks with examples of the ESP-Lab tools are available at [https://github.com/CESM-ESPWG/ESP-Lab/tree/main/docs/source/tutorials](https://github.com/CESM-ESPWG/ESP-Lab/tree/main/docs/source/tutorials).

# How to run the tutorial notebooks
1. It is recommended to use [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/) to run the ESP-Lab tutorial notebooks. To do so, first select a server configuration that you would like to use.
2. Clone the repository in your local directory. In a terminal on JupyterHub, navigate to the location where you'd like the tutorials to be cloned, and then run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/CESM-ESPWG/ESP-Lab.git`.
3. Activate a conda environment which has ESP-Lab installed ([see installation instructions](https://github.com/CESM-ESPWG/ESP-Lab/blob/main/docs/source/how-to/install-esp-lab.md)).
4. Create a kernel from your conda environment: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=esp_lab`
5. Navigate to the directory containing the tutorial you'd like to run.
6. Test out ESP-Lab with the tutorial!
